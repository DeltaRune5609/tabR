This program prompts you to take a break from using the laptop every hour, disabling you from unlocking it for 10 minutes, putting the laptop to sleep mode
unless you enter a four-digit pin and no gaming/miscellaneous programs are running (to ensure that emergencies are not interrupted, you can override it.)

This was originally made to stop myself from using my computer so much. I just decided to share it on here as a small little project.

By downloading or consenting to use this program, you agree it is provided "as is" and the original owner of the code is not responsible for any of your losses. You agree to hold them harmless.
